On a rainy afternoon in Lucknow,
little Meera folded a paper boat and whispered a wish into it. 
She placed it in the puddle outside her house,
watching it float away. Years later, as a young woman chasing dreams in a bustling city, she found a letter tucked inside an old book at a roadside stall. 
It was signed “To Meera, from the rain.” The words matched her childhood wish exactly.
She smiled, knowing some promises drift back when you least expect them.
